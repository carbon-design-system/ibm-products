## Overview

User avatars are a representation of a user or group of users. They can be used
to identify a user or indicate collaborators. By default the component will
display `name` on a 'order-1-cyan' background if name exist else it will render
a user icon. UserAvatar allows an image of the user to be displayed by passing
in the `image` prop as well as customizing icons using `renderIcon` prop.

## Migration from `UserProfileImage`

If you are currently using `UserProfileImage` you can use the following guide to
migrate to the newer `UserAvatar` component using the below command:

`npx @carbon/upgrade migrate ibm-products-update-userprofileimage --write`

The following props have been updated in `UserAvatar`:

`icon` has been replaced with `renderIcon`

`backgroundColor` remains the same but the values have changed. To see the new
values please refer to the component API table below.

`initials` has been replaced with `name`. Please refer to the component API
table below to see the new specifications.

`sm` has been added to the list of available `size` options

`theme` and `kind` have been removed

## Note on theming

The user avatar supports all the 4 theme variants from carbon (white, g10, g90
and g100). The backgroundColor and font color will adapt dynamically based on
the lighter and darker themes.
