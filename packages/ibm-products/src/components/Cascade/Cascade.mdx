# Cascade

[Carbon motion guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/motion/overview/)

## Overview

This pattern is intended for use with cards, tiles, or similarly styled
components. Use this patterns in areas that are the primary focus on the page to
help the user along their journey or locate the most important information on
the page. It should not be used on a page if it is the secondary focus of the
page as that will distract the user.

## Without Grid

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(Cascade.displayName, 'without-grid')} />
</Canvas>

## With Grid

When using `Cascade` with grid support it's important that you follow the
example code structure and provide the rows and columns. The component will
assume this structure and add the appropriate CSS classes to the columns.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(Cascade.displayName, 'with-grid')} />
</Canvas>

## Code sample

<CodesandboxLink exampleDirectory="Cascade" />

## Component API
