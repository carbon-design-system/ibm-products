## Overview

The CoachmarkOverlayElements is a composable container element, which should be
used only within the scope of a Coachmark or a CoachmarkFixed component. The
CoachmarkOverlayElements can contain one to N number of CoachmarkOverlayElement
components as children. When more than one CoachmarkOverlayElement component is
used in a CoachmarkOverlayElements, the components are displayed in a paginated
fashion within a carousel.

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Note on theming

The CoachmarkOverlayElements does not directly take a theme prop, rather it
relies on the cascade from classes being set in the Coachmark / CoachmarkFixed /
CoachmarkStack components.
