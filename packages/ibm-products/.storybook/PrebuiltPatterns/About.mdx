Patterns can be accomplished in multiple ways utilizing a combination of component(s) with additional design considerations.
The prebuilt patterns in this library are based on existing [patterns](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/patterns/overview/patterns/)
documented on the Carbon for IBM Products website, however, they are built like traditional components that can also be imported directly for use.

While these prebuilt patterns are available for use, they only capture a subset of use cases from the broader patterns they represent and may
result in limitations in their component APIs. For a more flexible approach, consider leveraging the equivalent pattern code.

## How prebuilt patterns and patterns differ

Prebuilt patterns can be useful, containing a number of features built-in. However, these have stricter APIs and may have limited flexibility.
Many of our patterns include “recipes,” that include a list of components used to deliver the pattern. These are often provided as example code
that you can adopt or extend further for your own use case.

## Prebuilt patterns to patterns

While many of these may not have pattern equivalents at this time, we will be adding more patterns.

| Prebuilt pattern name                | Pattern |
---------------------------------------|----------
| Add and select `MultiAddSelect`      | —
| Add and select `SingleAddSelect`     | —
| `APIKeyModal`                        | <LinkTo title="Patterns/Generate an API key" name="Overview">Generate an API key</LinkTo>
| Create flows `CreateFullPage`        | —
| Create flows `CreateModal`           | —
| Create flows `CreateSidePanel`       | —
| Create flows `CreateTearsheet`       | —
| Create flows `CreateTearsheetNarrow` | —
| `ExportModal`                        | —
| `ImportModal`                        | —
| `RemoveModal`                        | —
| `Saving`                             | —
| `WebTerminal`                        | —

## Prebuilt patterns to other alternatives

On occasion, new versions of our components (and prebuilt patterns) may be in progress in other libraries. These may also exist at different
points of Carbon’s [product development lifecycle](https://carbondesignsystem.com/contributing/product-development-lifecycle/).
