The `RemoveModal` covers what is known as high impact and medium impact
deleting. Enabling `textConfirmation` enables what would be considered the high
impact state of the modal. For additional information on differentiating between
delete / remove and low / medium / high impact please refer to the
[design usage guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/community/patterns/remove-pattern/#delete-remove-variations).
