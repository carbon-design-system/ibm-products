## Overview

The
[non-linear reading](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/nonlinear-reading/usage/)
component provides a way to explain concepts more broadly and succinctly while
allowing users to read more detail as needed without leaving their context.

Use non-linear reading when space is limited to share a brief, at-a-glance,
summary of a concept that may require more explanation for some users. You can
also use this component when the level of detail or the amount of context needed
on a topic will vary across users and you don’t want to over-explain to more
mature users. Non-linear reading is helpful to provide context for the first
time a user engages with the product as well as for introducing new concepts
later on as they get more familiar with base-level functionality.

_[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology + framework aimed to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users._

## Example usage

### Minimal

All you need for the basics.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'single-level')} />
</Canvas>

### In series

Multiple non-linear reading components can be used in the same text block.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'multiple-level')} />
</Canvas>

```jsx
After we create your
  <NonLinearReading
    definition={
      <>
        <Link
          href="https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-xdr-connect"
          target={'_blank'}
          rel="noreferrer"
        >
          XDR Connect’s

        correlation engine <strong>creates the case for you</strong>, by
        processing data from alerts across multiple security tools—including
        your own connected security systems—in order to save you time.
      </>
    }
  >
    case,
  </NonLinearReading>
  we also
  <NonLinearReading
    definition="By starting the investigation, we help to reduce your manual workload. We gather all available evidence for you to review; use Watson Cybersecurity to scrape the web for additional, previously unknown threat intelligence; and start taking note of anything that happened before and after the incident, to get a more detailed view."
  >
    investigate
  </NonLinearReading>
for you. More insights are uncovered by analyzing relevant data from your
tools, and enriching them. We visualize the incident’s progression on the
Attack graph; and we recommend remediation steps.
```

### Embedded

Non-linear reading components can be embedded one inside another.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'embedded')} />
</Canvas>

```jsx
Findings are created by the
  <NonLinearReading
    definition={
      <>
        We examine the alerts from each source, and
        <NonLinearReading
          definition="Correlation allows us to identify connections between common observables, tactics, and techniques, and to remove any duplicate data, thereby streamlining the investigation for you."
        >
          correlate
        </NonLinearReading>
        them together with rules. While a case can contain multiple alerts,
        a single finding can only be created from a single alert. So, when
        you select a finding, you can drill right down to the raw data
        behind it: the payload. We also use our
        <NonLinearReading
          definition="Our threat intelligence service contains an enrichment capability. During the enrichment process, we add context that is used to establish the severity of artifacts associated with a finding. This is what determines the severity of the finding itself. Bear in mind that each case can have multiple findings, and every finding will have its own severity."
        >
          threat intelligence service
        </NonLinearReading>
        to establish the severity of the artifacts.
      </>
    }
  >
    alerts ingested
  </NonLinearReading>
from your own security systems. The findings here are confirmed findings
that have been created from alerts ingested from your own sources, before
being enriched to create cases.
