## Overview

The CoachmarkOverlayElements pattern acts as a container element for onboarding
and should only be used within the scope of a Coachmark.

> NOTE: Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically
> use a combination of components with additional design considerations. The
> pattern code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can
> be built and extended further.

#### Ingredients

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [Coachmark](https://carbon-for-ibm-products.netlify.app/?path=/docs/preview-onboarding-coachmark--overview)
- [Button](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button)
- [Link](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-link)
- [Theme](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-theme)
- [Carousel utility](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/utilities/src/carousel/README.md)

```jsx
import { Button, Theme, Link as CarbonLink } from '@carbon/react';
import {
  preview__CoachmarkBeacon as CoachmarkBeacon,
  preview__Coachmark as Coachmark,
} from '@carbon/ibm-products';
import { InitCarousel, initCarousel } from '@carbon/utilities';
```

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.
