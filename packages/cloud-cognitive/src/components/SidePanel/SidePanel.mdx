[CD&AI Side Panel usage guidelines](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/side-panel/usage)

## Overview

`Side panel`s keep users in-context of a page while performing tasks like
navigating, editing, viewing details, or configuring something new.

`Side panel`s are a fluid component and found in a few primary use-cases used
for various reasons. The user needs to see the panel information in the context

the content on the page, and simple create flows. There are variants for these
use-cases that require different widths and behaviors based on the content
within them.
