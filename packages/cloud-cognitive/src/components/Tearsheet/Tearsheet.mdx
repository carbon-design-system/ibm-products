## Overview

A tearsheet is a mostly full-screen type of dialog that keeps users in-context
and focused by bringing actionable content front and center while revealing
parts of the UI behind it. There are two sizes of tearsheets: narrow and wide.

A tearsheet is comprised of up to 5 zones, allowing for flexibility depending on
the content.

1. **Header zone:** Includes a one or more of a label, title, description,
   navigation area (e.g. for tabs) and close icon.
2. **Main content area:** This typically contains forms, tables, and items that
   a user may interact with.
3. **Navigation buttons:** Used to navigate the flow and to finalize/complete
   the steps required.
4. **Influencer:** This usually contains a menu, vertical progress indicator, or
   filters. Can be on the left or right, and has 2 possible widths. Not
   available in narrow tearsheets.
5. **Background overlay:** Obscures underlying page content.

Tearsheets may be stacked up to 3 levels deep.
