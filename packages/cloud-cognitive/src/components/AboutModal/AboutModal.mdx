## Overview

The `AboutModal` component provides a way to communicate product information to
users. It is triggered by a user’s action, appears on top of the main page
content, and is persistent until dismissed. The purpose of this modal should be
immediately apparent to the user, with a clear and obvious path to completion.

## Example usage

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(AboutModal.displayName, 'fully-loaded')} />
</Canvas>

### Overriding the Carbon theme

The design recommendation is to use a dark theme for the AboutModal if the
application is currently using a light theme, and vice versa. The theme applied
to the AboutModal can easily be customized as follows:

In SCSS:

```SCSS
  .#{$pkg-prefix}--about-modal {
    @include carbon--theme(
      $theme: $carbon--theme--g90
    );
  }
```

Alternatively, the required Carbon theme can be set as above in a custom CSS
class which is then applied to the AboutModal using the `className` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(AboutModal.displayName, 'with-dark-theme')} />
</Canvas>
