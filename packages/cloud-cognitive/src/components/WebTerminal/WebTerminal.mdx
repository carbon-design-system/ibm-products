# WebTerminal

[CD&AI WebTerminal usage guidelines](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/patterns/web-terminal/)

## Overview

The `WebTerminal` is prompted by the user and is persistent until dismissed. The
purpose of a web terminal is to provide users with the ability to type commands
manually instead of using the GUI.

#### Why do we need an open prop?

You have to pass an `open` prop which toggles from `true` to `false` or `false`
to `true`. In this case I am using the global navigation terminal icon to
trigger this `onClick`. It was designed this way so you can open the web
terminal in any context like within a data table or button.

#### Why do we need a closeTerminal callback?

It is very important that you pass the `closeTerminal` function setting your
provided `open` prop to false. We didn't add the logic to close the web terminal
from the component because we want you, the developer, to be able to pass in any
other operations you want to do like error checks or a confirmation modal before
the user closes the modal.

Example:

```jsx
const [isTerminalOpen, setIsTerminalOpen] = useState(false);
const closeTerminal = () => setIsTerminalOpen(false)

<WebTerminal open={isTerminalOpen} closeTerminal={closeTerminal}>
  ...
</WebTerminal>
```

#### Passing in your own terminal.

The `WebTerminal` is wrapper component for your own terminal component that you
may have been using for your product. Simply pass your own terminal component as
children.

#### Help user's with helpful documentation links

Optionally you can pass documentation links to help point your users to useful
documentation for your terminal, or kubernetes commands etc.

### Default

The default web terminal is one which opens and the terminal loads. Then if the
user desires to dismiss it they can click the close icon on the top right corner
of the component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(WebTerminal.displayName, 'default')} />
</Canvas>

### With documentation links

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(WebTerminal.displayName, 'with-documentation-links')} />
</Canvas>

### With actions

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(WebTerminal.displayName, 'with-actions')} />
</Canvas>

Optionally you can add actions to the web terminal header bar. To add actions
you need to pass in an array of actions with objects for each object.

```jsx
<WebTerminal
  actions={[
    {
      renderIcon: Code32,
      onClick: () => {},
      iconDescription: 'Create new deployment',
    },
  ]}>
  ...
</WebTerminal>
```
