## Overview

The page header is comprised of 6 zones, allowing for the flexibility to include
(or exclude) areas depending on the context and needs of the page.

1. **Breadcrumbs:** This zone is for the breadcrumb component to be displayed.
   Breadcrumbs should typically be displayed if there are navigable pages that
   precede the current page.
2. **Page title:** This zone is for a page title to be displayed. Optionally an
   icon can be included to the left of the title text.
3. **Subtitle / description (optional):** This zone is for the inclusion of a
   subtitle or description to provide additional context to identify the current
   page.
4. **Available space (optional):** This zone is for placing high-level content
   above page tabs.
5. **Tabs (optional):** This zone is for placing navigation within a page. e.g.
   tabs, content switcher etc.
6. **Actions (optional):** This zone is for placing critical page actions.

## Usage Notes for Developers

On scroll the PageHeader can be configured to allow the breadcrumb row and/or
the navigation row to stick to the top of the page, with content scrolling below
it.

In order for this to be successful the following conditions must be met:

1. The PageHeader should be a peer of the structure where the content is placed.
2. The z-index of the content should not exceed that of the PageHeader. This is
   set by a Carbon SCSS function `z('header')` which currently evaluates
   to 8000.

## Main types

### Page header without background

The simplest expression of the page header. A background-less page header should
be used if only the breadcrumb, title, actions, and/or simple status are
required.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withButtons} />
</Canvas>

### Page header with background

The more complex expression of the page header. The background provides
structurality and aids in establishing hierarchy for page headers with more
items. The page header with a background should be used if tabs, subtitles,
and/or more global items are required.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withTabs} />
</Canvas>

### Page header with background (breadcrumb + actions toolbar included)

If the page header contains action icons, the default state includes a toolbar
designated for the breadcrumbs and action icons.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={stories.withActionsToolbar} />
</Canvas>

### Page header with background (breadcrumb + actions toolbar ONLY)

On occasion, a condensed page header is required. This version accommodates this
by just displaying the breadcrumb bar only.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withBreadcrumbActionsToolbarOnly} />
</Canvas>

## Examples

The page header allows for the flexibility to additively contain both type and
components with predictable spacing in the overall layout.

### Examples without background

#### Page title only

This is the base of the page header, establishing spacing/title structure that
all other sans background page headers follow. The base is best used to
accommodate simple requirements, including page title only, or page title +
buttons.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withTitle} />
</Canvas>

#### With breadcrumbs

This variant of the page header accounts for page title, buttons, breadcrumbs,
and occasionally icons and metadata.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withBreadcrumbs} />
</Canvas>

#### With status indicator

Structured similarly to the examples above, this variant is for the inclusion of
a page level status indicator.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withButtons} />
</Canvas>

### Examples with background

#### With tabs

Tabs are positioned underneath the page title and sit flush at the base of the
page header background.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withTabs} />
</Canvas>

#### With tags

Tags are positioned underneath the page title and sit above the base of the page
header background.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withTags} />
</Canvas>

#### With tabs & tags

If both tabs & tags need to be present, tabs should be remain left aligned with
the page and tags reposition over to the right side of the screen.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withTabsAndTags} />
</Canvas>

#### With subtitle

Subtitles, if necessary, are placed directly below the page title. Page headers
with subtitles use the background to create hierarchy and to separate it from
type placed within the page.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withSubtitle} />
</Canvas>

#### With summary details

Page content with global page hierarchy can be placed above tabs within the page
header. **This is just an example of an allowable zone for content.**

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.withSummaryDetails} />
</Canvas>
