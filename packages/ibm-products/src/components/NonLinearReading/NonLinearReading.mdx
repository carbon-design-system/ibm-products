## Overview

The
[non-linear reading](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/nonlinear-reading/usage/)
component provides a way to explain concepts more broadly and succinctly,
providing in-context detail to the user without requiring them to redirect to
another location.

When space is limited, use non-linear reading to share a brief, at-a-glance
summary of a concept that may require more explanation for some users. You can
also use this component when the level of detail or the amount of context needed
on a topic will vary across users and you don’t want to over-explain to more
mature users. Non-linear reading provides helpful context for the user’s initial
engagement with the product, and enables the introduction of new concepts as the
user becomes more familiar with base-level functionality later on.

## About Novice to pro

[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Example usage

### Single level

All you need for the basics.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'single-level')} />
</Canvas>

### Multiple level

Multiple, embedded, non-linear reading components can be used in the same text
block.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'multiple-level')} />
</Canvas>

### With gradient background

Some other Novice to pro components use a gradient background as shown.

If using NonLinearReading inside one of these components, always use
`theme="dark"`.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    id={getStoryId(NonLinearReading.displayName, 'with-gradient-background')}
  />
</Canvas>
