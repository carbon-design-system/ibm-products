## Overview

[Beacons](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/onboarding/coachmark/usage#tooltip)
use a pulsing action to call a user’s attention to a specific area in the UI.

The `target` prop of the Coachmark should always be either a CoachmarkBeacon or
a CoachmarkButton.

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Note on theming

The CoachmarkBeacon is theme-agnostic; it is always a blue visual displayed in
one of two states, animated or active.

## Example usage

<Canvas className="coachmarkExample" withSource="none">
  <div className="CoachmarkBaseExampleUsage">
    <Story of={CoachmarkBeaconStories.coachmarkBeacon} />
  </div>
</Canvas>

## Code sample

```jsx
<Coachmark
  theme={'light'}
  target={<CoachmarkBeacon label="Show information" kind={'tooltip'} />}
>
  ...
</Coachmark>
```

## Component API
