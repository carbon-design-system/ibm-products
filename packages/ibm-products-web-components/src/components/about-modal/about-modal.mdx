The AboutModal component provides a way to communicate product information to
users. It is triggered by a user’s action, appears on top of the main page
content, and is persistent until dismissed. The purpose of this modal should be
immediately apparent to the user, with a clear and obvious path to completion.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

import '@carbon/ibm-products-web-components/es/components/about-modal/index.js';
```

### HTML

```html
<c4p-about-modal> </c4p-about-modal>
```

## `<c4p-about-modal>` attributes, properties and events

<ArgTypes of="c4p-about-modal" />
