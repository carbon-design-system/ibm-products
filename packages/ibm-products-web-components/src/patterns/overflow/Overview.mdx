# Item overflow

item overflow are a group of patterns built using
[overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a
combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern
code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built
and extended further.

### 1) Set of Tags

The Set of Tags pattern displays a row of tags. If there isn’t enough space to
show all of them, the overflowing tags are grouped in a popover, triggered by an
overflow button labeled +N.

If there are more than 10 overflowing tags, a View all tags button appears in
the popover. Clicking it opens a modal that displays the full list of tags.

This pattern is commonly used to filter or categorize content.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-tag cds-dismissible-tag cds-operational-tag](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-tag--overview)
- [cds-popover](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-popover--overview)
- [cds-modal](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-tags` wrapper component to handle
state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfTags.SetOfTags} sourceState="none" />

### 2) Set of Actions

The Set of Actions pattern displays a row of actions in the form of icon
buttons. If there isn’t enough space to show all of them, the overflowing
actions are grouped into an overflow menu.

There is also a vertical variant available to display actions.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-icon-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-icon-button--overview)
- [cds-overflow-menu](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-overflow-menu--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-actions` wrapper component to
handle state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfActions.SetOfActions} sourceState="none" />

### 3) Set of UserAvatars

The Set of UserAvatars pattern displays a row of user avatars. If there isn’t
enough space to show all of them, the overflowing avatars are grouped in a
popover, triggered by an overflow button labeled +N.

If there are more than 10 overflowing users, a View all users button appears in
the popover. Clicking it opens a modal that displays the full list of users.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [c4p-user-avatar](?path=/docs/experimental-useravatar--docs)
- [cds-popover](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-popover--overview)
- [cds-modal](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-users` wrapper component to handle
state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfUsers.SetOfUsers} sourceState="none" />

### 4) Set of Breadcrumbs

The Set of Breadcrumbs pattern displays a horizontal trail of links representing
the user's navigation path. If there isn’t enough space to show all of them, the
overflowing breadcrumbs are grouped into an overflow menu.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-breadcrumb](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-breadcrumb--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-breadcrumbs` wrapper component to
handle state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfBreadcrumbs.SetOfBreadcrumbs} sourceState="none" />

### 5) Collapsible button-set

this is different from button-set with container queries, this will show a group
of buttons collapse into a
[menu-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-menu-button--overview)
