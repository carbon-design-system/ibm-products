## Overview

The following are drag and drop examples building upon the examples on the
[PAL site](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/patterns/drag-and-drop/usage).
While we are currently not providing these as exported components to use
directly, they can be used as references for drag and drop interactions. The
examples provided use `@dnd-kit`, also used in `@carbon/ibm-products` for
customizing the order of columns in the Datagrid.

{/* We do provide styles for some of the drag states as detailed below. */}

{/* |                        | State                                     | class |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Default draggable item | `${pkg.prefix}__draggable-item`           |
| Dragging               | `${pkg.prefix}__draggable-item--dragging` |       | */}
