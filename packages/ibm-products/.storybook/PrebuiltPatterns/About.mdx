Patterns can be accomplished in multiple ways utilizing one or more components
with additional design considerations. The prebuilt patterns in this library are
based on existing
[patterns](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/patterns/overview/patterns/)
documented on the Carbon for IBM Products website, however, they are built like
traditional components that can also be imported directly for use.

While these prebuilt patterns are available for use directly in code, they only
capture a subset of use cases from the broader patterns they represent and their
flexibility may be limited by their component APIs. For a more flexible
approach, consider leveraging the equivalent pattern code.

## How prebuilt patterns and patterns differ

Prebuilt patterns can be useful, containing a number of features built-in.
However, prebuilt patterns have stricter APIs and may have limited flexibility.
Many of our patterns include “recipes” that list the components used to deliver
the pattern. These are often provided as example code that you can adopt or
extend further for your own use case.

## Prebuilt patterns to patterns

While many of the prebuilt patterns may not have pattern equivalents at this
time, we will be adding more patterns in the future.

## Prebuilt patterns to other alternatives

On occasion, new versions of our components and prebuilt patterns may be in
progress in other libraries. These may also exist at different points of
Carbon's
[Product Development Lifecycle](https://carbondesignsystem.com/contributing/product-development-lifecycle/).
