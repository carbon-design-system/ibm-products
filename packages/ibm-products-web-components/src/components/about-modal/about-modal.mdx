[![Edit carbon-web-components](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/carbon-design-system/ibm-products/tree/main/packages/ibm-products-web-components/examples/about-modal)

The AboutModal component provides a way to communicate product information to users. It is triggered by a userâ€™s action, appears on top of the main page content, and is persistent until dismissed. The purpose of this modal should be immediately apparent to the user, with a clear and obvious path to completion.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibm-products-web-components/es/components/about-modal/index.js';
```


### HTML

```html
<c4p-about-modal>
</c4p-about-modal>
```

## `<c4p-about-modal>` attributes, properties and events

<ArgTypes of="c4p-about-modal" />
