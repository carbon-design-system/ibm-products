## 1) Set of Tags

The Set of tags displays a collection of tags that overflow into a popover when
there are too many to fit on a single line. This pattern is commonly used to
filter or categorize content, allowing users to access additional tags in a
popover via the overflow operational tag.

Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a
combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern
code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built
and extended further.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-tag](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal)
- [cds-popover](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-form-group)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-tags` wrapper component to handle
state management.

## 2) Set of Actions

The Set of actions displays a group of actions in the form of icon-buttons which
gets collapsed into an overflow menu when the width is constrained.

Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a
combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern
code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built
and extended further.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-icon-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-icon-button--overview)
- [cds-overflow-menu](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-overflow-menu--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-actions` wrapper component to

## 3) Set of UserAvatars

## 4) Collapsible button-set

this is different from button-set with container queries, this will show a group
of buttons collapse into a
[menu-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-menu-button--overview)

## 5) Collapsible breadcrumbs
