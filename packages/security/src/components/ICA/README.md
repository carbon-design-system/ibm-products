# Important Content Area (ICA) component

## Value truncation

ICA components provide a simple way to display numerical values. Even for long
numbers, this component truncates these numbers so they render as short as
possible. It follows different language conventions to do so and consuming
developers are expected to provide the locale code for their users for the
component to truncate correctly. The default locale is English (`en`) if one is
not provided or if the provided one is not supported.
