# Delete and remove pattern

‚ÄúRemoving‚Äù is an action that moves information from one location to another.
Removal can be both destructive and non-destructive. ‚ÄúDeletion‚Äù is the most
common type of removal and is destructive

[![Edit carbon-web-components](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/carbon-design-system/ibm-products/tree/main/packages/ibm-products-web-components/examples/delete-pattern)

Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a
combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern
code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built
and extended further.

#### Ingredients

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-modal](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal)
- [cds-text-input](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-text-input--overview)
- [cds-toast-notification](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-notifications-toast--overview)
- [cds-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--overview)

## High impact deletion

A high-impact deletion cannot be reversed. The action would result in a
significant loss for a user if done accidentally.

When deleting is high-impact, a confirmation dialog should be presented to the
user which displays:

- The name of the resource
- Consequences of the deletion
- This action cannot be undone.
- An editable text field for the name of the resource to be entered

For high-impact scenarios, a user should confirm the action by manually entering
the name of the resource. The ‚ÄòDelete‚Äô button is enabled when the text entered
perfectly matches the resource name.

### Example

Here's a quick example to get you started.

All of the carbon web components listed under 'ingredients' section are used
within a wrapper component `delete-pattern` to handle state management required
for the functionality.

#### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/modal/index.js';
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/form/form-item.js';
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/text-input/text-input.js';
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/notification/toast-notification.js';
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/checkbox/checkbox.js';
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/link/link.js';
```

#### HTML

```html
<cds-modal size="sm" ?open="${this.isOpen}" prevent-close>
  <cds-modal-header>
    <cds-modal-close-button @click="${this._close}"></cds-modal-close-button>
    <cds-modal-label>Delete project</cds-modal-label>
    <cds-modal-heading>Confirm delete</cds-modal-heading>
  </cds-modal-header>
  <cds-modal-body>
    <cds-modal-body-content description>
      Deleting project will permanently delete the project and all related
      configurations from the system. This action cannot be undone.
    </cds-modal-body-content>
    <cds-form-item>
      <cds-text-input
        placeholder="Name of resource"
        label="Type ${this.resourceName} to confirm"
        value="${this._textInput}"
        @input="${this._onInputChange}"
        autocomplete="off"
      >
      </cds-text-input>
    </cds-form-item>
  </cds-modal-body>
  <cds-modal-footer>
    <cds-modal-footer-button kind="secondary" @click="${this._close}"
      >Cancel</cds-modal-footer-button
    >
    <cds-modal-footer-button
      ?disabled="${!this._enableDelete}"
      kind="danger"
      @click="${this._onDelete}"
    >
      Delete
    </cds-modal-footer-button>
  </cds-modal-footer>
</cds-modal>

<cds-toast-notification
  class="notification"
  kind="success"
  title="Successfully deleted project"
  subtitle="${this.resourceName} project has been deleted"
  caption="10:10:00 AM"
  hide-close-button="true"
  low-contrast="true"
  timeout="3000"
  @cds-notification-closed="${this.onNotificationClose}"
></cds-toast-notification>
```

### High impact deletion with connected items

It is similar to high-impact deletion pattern, but the confirmation dialog will
display the below 2 additional content:

- list of all the connected items
- checkbox to confirm the deletion the all its connected items.

### High impact batch deletion

In batch deletion, a confirmation dialog should be presented to the user which
displays:

- The names of the items selected
- The consequences of the deletion
- The phrase, ‚ÄúThis action cannot be undone‚Äù
- A checkbox to confirm the deletion of the selected resources
- A note of items that cannot be deleted in batch selection (optional)

## Medium impact deletion or removal

A medium-impact deletion is one that cannot be reversed, but would not be
catastrophic if done accidentally. When deleting is medium-impact, a
confirmation dialog should be presented to the user which displays:

- The name of the resource
- Consequences of the deletion
- The action cannot be undone.

> NOTE: The medium-impact removal pattern is similar to medium-impact deletion
> pattern, with the only difference being the usage of ‚Äúremove‚Äù or ‚Äúdelete‚Äú in
> the text. Use ‚Äúremove‚Äù when the action is reversible or not truly destructive.

### Example

Here's a quick example to get you started.

All of the carbon web components listed under 'ingredients' section are used
within a wrapper component `delete-pattern` to handle state management required
for the functionality.

#### HTML

```html
<cds-modal size="sm" ?open="${this.isOpen}" prevent-close>
  <cds-modal-header>
    <cds-modal-close-button @click="${this._close}"></cds-modal-close-button>
    <cds-modal-label>Delete project</cds-modal-label>
    <cds-modal-heading>Confirm delete</cds-modal-heading>
  </cds-modal-header>
  <cds-modal-body>
    <cds-modal-body-content description>
      Deleting project will permanently delete the project and all related
      configurations from the system. This action cannot be undone.
    </cds-modal-body-content>
  </cds-modal-body>
  <cds-modal-footer>
    <cds-modal-footer-button kind="secondary" @click="${this._close}"
      >Cancel</cds-modal-footer-button
    >
    <cds-modal-footer-button kind="danger" @click="${this._onDelete}">
      Delete
    </cds-modal-footer-button>
  </cds-modal-footer>
</cds-modal>
<cds-toast-notification
  class="notification"
  kind="success"
  title="Successfully deleted project"
  subtitle="${this.resourceName} project has been deleted"

  hide-close-button="true"
  low-contrast="true"
  timeout="3000"
  @cds-notification-closed="${this.onNotificationClose}"
></cds-toast-notification>
```

## Low impact deletion or removal

Requiring the user to confirm deletion is generally recommended. However, in low
impact situations, or when an ‚Äòundo‚Äô option is available, user confirmation may
not be required.

> NOTE: The low-impact removal pattern is similar to low-impact deletion
> pattern, with the only difference being the usage of ‚Äúremove‚Äù or ‚Äúdelete‚Äú in
