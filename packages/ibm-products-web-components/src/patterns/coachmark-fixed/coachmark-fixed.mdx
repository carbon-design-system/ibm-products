# CoachmarkFixedStories

[CoachmarkFixedStories usage guidelines](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/patterns/coachmark-fixed/usage/)

## Overview

The CoachmarkFixed pattern acts as a container element for onboarding and should only be used within the scope of a Coachmark.

## Coded examples

Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a
combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern
code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built
and extended further.

#### Ingredients

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [Coachmark](https://ibm-products-web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-coachmark)
- [Coachmark Beacon](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button)
- [Carousel utility](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/utilities/src/carousel/README.md)

    }
  ]}
></Canvas>
