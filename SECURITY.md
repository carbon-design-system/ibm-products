## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, report a vulnerability through GitHub’s
[security advisory feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-products/security/advisories/new)
via new issues.

Please include a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the
issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigation steps for the issue. Our
team aims to respond to all new vulnerability reports within 7 business days.

Additional information on reporting vulnerabilities to IBM is available at
<https://www.ibm.com/trust/security-psirt>

## Preferred languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.
