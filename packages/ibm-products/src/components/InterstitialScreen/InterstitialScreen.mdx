## Overview

[Interstitial screen](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/components/onboarding/interstitial-screen/usage)
can be a full page or an overlay, and are shown on the first time a user
accesses a new experience (e.g. upon first login or first time opening a page
where a newly purchased capability is presented).

## Expected Composability

The InterstitialScreen component is structured using the compound component pattern in React, with distinct and well-defined sections: **Header, Body, and Footer**.
InterstitialScreen acting as a container and **InterstitialScreen.Header, InterstitialScreen.Body, InterstitialScreen.Footer** 
are static properties of the InterstitialScreen component, effectively acting as sub-components.All related parts of the screen (Header, Body, Footer) are 
grouped under one logical component: InterstitialScreen.You can mix and match subcomponents or even omit some.


## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.
