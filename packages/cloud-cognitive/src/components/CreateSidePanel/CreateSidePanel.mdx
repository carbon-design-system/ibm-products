## Overview

The `CreateSidePanel` component provides a way for a user to quickly generate a
new resource. It is triggered by a user’s action, slides in from the right,
pushes over the main page's content, and is persistent until dismissed. The
purpose of this side panel should be immediately apparent to the user, with a
clear and obvious path to completion.

## Example usage

Here it is in use.

<Canvas>
  <Story id={getStoryId(CreateSidePanel.displayName, 'default')} />
</Canvas>

## Form validation

All forms, including that within the `CreateSidePanel` should follow C&CS
guidelines for form validation.

This includes the following:

- The `Submit` button in the side panel should be disabled, until all required
  inputs are filled in and valid
- All required inputs should _only_ throw an invalid error _after_ the element
  loses focus
- All optional form fields should have an `(optional)` text at the end of the
  input `labelText`. Optional should always be in parentheses

You can find more information on how to validate your form fields in
[Carbon's Form usage page](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/form/usage).
