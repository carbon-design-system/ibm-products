## Overview

[CoachmarkFixed](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/novice-to-pro/components/coachmark/usage/#fixed)
appears fixed at the bottom right corner of the browser window when the page
loads. It starts in a minimized state, to cover as little of the UI as possible;
when shown in tests as expanded by default, users immediately closed it without
reading, to get it out of the way. When dismissed, it slides down off the page.

## About Novice to pro

[Novice to pro](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/novice-to-pro/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Note on theming

The CoachmarkFixed uses the theme prop (e.g., theme='dark') to set the
appropriate background and font colors for the overlay. Specify a value ('light'
or 'dark') to display properly within your usage.
