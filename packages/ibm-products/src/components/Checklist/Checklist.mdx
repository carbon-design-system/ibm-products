## Overview

The Checklist tracks a user's progress much like Your Learning or WalkMe. Each
item in the list can be clickable, and each item has an icon that defines the
item's state as "not started", "in progress", and "complete".

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.
