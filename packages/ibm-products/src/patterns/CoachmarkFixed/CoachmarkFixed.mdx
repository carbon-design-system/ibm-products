## Overview

The CoachmarkFixed pattern acts as a container element for onboarding and should
only be used within the scope of a Coachmark.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [Coachmark](https://carbon-for-ibm-products.netlify.app/?path=/docs/experimental-onboarding-coachmark-next--overview)
- [cds-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button)
- Carousel utility
