## Overview

The CoachmarkOverlayElements pattern acts as a container element for onboarding
and should only be used within the scope of a Coachmark.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [Coachmark](https://carbon-for-ibm-products.netlify.app/?path=/docs/experimental-onboarding-coachmark-next--overview)
- [cds-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button)
- Carousel utility

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.
