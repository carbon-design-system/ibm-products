## Overview

The CoachmarkFixed pattern acts as a container element for onboarding and should
only be used within the scope of a Coachmark.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [Coachmark](https://carbon-for-ibm-products.netlify.app/?path=/docs/preview-onboarding-coachmark--overview)
- [Button](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button)
- [Carousel utility](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/utilities/src/carousel/README.md)
