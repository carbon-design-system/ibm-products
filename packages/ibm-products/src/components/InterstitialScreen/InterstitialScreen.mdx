## Overview

[Interstitial screen](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/onboarding/interstitial/usage)
can be a full page or an overlay, and are shown on the first time a user
accesses a new experience (e.g. upon first login or first time opening a page
where a newly purchased capability is presented).

## Expected Composability

Interstitial Screen was designed to be used with N number of
**InterstitialScreenView** children. As a convenience, a provided
**InterstitialScreenViewModule** is also available, although not required as a
child of InterstitialScreenView.

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/teams-across-security/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.
