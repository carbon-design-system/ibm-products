Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built and extended further.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:
- [cds-modal](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal)
- [cds-text-input](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-text-input--overview)
- [cds-toast-notification](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-notifications-toast--overview)


## Example

### High impact deletion

<Canvas layout="fullscreen" >
  <Story of={deleteStories.highImpactDeletion} />
</Canvas>
