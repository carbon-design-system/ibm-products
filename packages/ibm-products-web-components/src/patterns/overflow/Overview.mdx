# Item overflow

item overflow are a group of patterns built using
[overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a
combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern
code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built
and extended further.

### 1) Set of Tags

The Set of Tags pattern displays a row of tags. If there isnâ€™t enough space to
show all of them, the overflowing tags are grouped in a popover, triggered by an
overflow button labeled +N.

If there are more than 10 overflowing tags, a View all tags button appears in
the popover. Clicking it opens a modal that displays the full list of tags.

This pattern is commonly used to filter or categorize content.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-tag cds-dismissible-tag cds-operational-tag](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-tag--overview)
- [cds-popover](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-popover--overview)
- [cds-modal](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-tags` wrapper component to handle
state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfTags.SetOfTags} sourceState="none" />

### 2) Set of Actions

The Set of Actions pattern displays a row of actions in the form of icon
buttons. If there isnâ€™t enough space to show all of them, the overflowing
actions are grouped into an overflow menu.

There is also a vertical variant available to display actions.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-icon-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-icon-button--overview)
- [cds-overflow-menu](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-overflow-menu--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-actions` wrapper component to
handle state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfActions.SetOfActions} sourceState="none" />

### 3) Set of UserAvatars

The Set of UserAvatars pattern displays a row of user avatars. If there isnâ€™t
enough space to show all of them, the overflowing avatars are grouped in a
popover, triggered by an overflow button labeled +N.

If there are more than 10 overflowing users, a View all users button appears in
the popover. Clicking it opens a modal that displays the full list of users.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [c4p-user-avatar](?path=/docs/experimental-useravatar--docs)
- [cds-popover](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-popover--overview)
- [cds-modal](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-users` wrapper component to handle
state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfUsers.SetOfUsers} sourceState="none" />

### 4) Set of Breadcrumbs

The Set of Breadcrumbs pattern displays a horizontal trail of links representing
the user's navigation path. If there isnâ€™t enough space to show all of them, the
overflowing breadcrumbs are grouped into an overflow menu.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [cds-breadcrumb](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-breadcrumb--overview)

and the following utility:

- [overflowHandler](?path=/docs/experimental-utilities-overflowhandler--docs)

These components are used within the `set-of-breadcrumbs` wrapper component to
handle state management.

<Canvas of={SetOfBreadcrumbs.SetOfBreadcrumbs} sourceState="none" />

### 5) Collapsible button-set

this is different from button-set with container queries, this will show a group
of buttons collapse into a
[menu-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-menu-button--overview)
