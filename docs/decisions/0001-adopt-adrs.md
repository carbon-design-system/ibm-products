# Title

Adopt ADR's

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Maintaining documents that help contextualize the decision making progress is
essential to current and future developers of Carbon For IBM Products. It's
important and useful to document the reasoning, discussions, and individuals
surrounding any major changes to the code base including things like
deprecations, new components / patterns, and deprecations.

Implementing architectural decision records as part of our software lifecycle
can help to document the progression of the repository in a way that's easier to
understand than tediously going through commit and slack history.

## Decision

ADR's will be adopted and used moving forward for any architectural decisions
made within the repo. Any features or code changes that have an impact to the
overall architecture of Carbon For IBM Products or to core components and
patterns should include an ADR document as part of the commit.

## Consequences
