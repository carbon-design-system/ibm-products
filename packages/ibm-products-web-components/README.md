> Carbon for IBM Products web components

## Getting started

If you‚Äôre just getting started and looking to browse our React components, take
a look at
[our Storybook](https://ibm-products-web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/).

### üì¶ Installing Carbon for IBM Products web components

To use Carbon for IBM Products web components, all you need to do is install the
`@carbon/ibm-products-web-components` package.

```shell
$ yarn add @carbon/ibm-products-web-components

# or

$ npm install @carbon/ibm-products-web-components
```

Then you can import the component styles in your `index.js`.

```js
import '@carbon/ibm-products/css/index.min.css';
```

### Usage

The `@carbon/web-components` package provides components for the Carbon Design
System.

To use a component, you can import it directly from the package:

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibm-products-web-components/es/components/about-modal.js';
```

Once you've imported the component modules, you can use the components in the
same manner as native HTML tags:

```html
<c4p-about-modal
  closeIconDescription="Close"
  copyrightText="Copyright ¬© IBM Corp. 2025"
  .title="IBM Product Name"
  .version="0.0.0"
></c4p-about-modal>
```
