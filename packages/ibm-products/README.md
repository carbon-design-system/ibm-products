# @carbon/ibm-products

> Carbon for IBM Products is an open source implementation of the closed source
> [pattern asset library (PAL)](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/).
> These PAL designs build on the foundation of IBM’s open source Carbon Design
> System and React implementation to offer components and patterns beyond the
> typical component library. Carbon for IBM Products was previously known as
> Carbon for IBM Cloud and Cognitive (@carbon/ibm-cloud-cognitive), and this
> name can still be encountered in various places and historical logs.

> Carbon for IBM Products common UI components

## 🚀 Getting started

If you’re just getting started and looking to browse our React components, take
a look at [our Storybook](https://ibm-products.carbondesignsystem.com).

### 📦 Installing Carbon for IBM Products

To use Carbon for IBM Products components, all you need to do is install the
`@carbon/ibm-products` package.

```shell
$ yarn add @carbon/ibm-products

# or

$ npm install @carbon/ibm-products
```

Then you can import the component styles in your `index.js`.

```js
import '@carbon/ibm-products/css/index.min.css';
```

### Webpack 4

Our package requires support for ES modules (see
[#2378](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-products/issues/2378#issuecomment-1319276192)).
In Webpack 5, these are supported by default. In Webpack 4, you will need to add
the [following rule](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72149467) to your config.

```js
rules: [
  {
    test: /\.mjs$/,
    include: /node_modules/,
    type: 'javascript/auto',
  },
],
```

### Peer dependencies

`@carbon/ibm-products` is built on top of Carbon components and has a number of
dependencies which need to be installed.

- Install
  [`carbon-components-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/carbon-components-react)
  as per package instructions
- Install
  [`@carbon/icons-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/icons-react) as
  per package instructions
- Install [`@carbon/elements`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@carbon/elements)
  as per package instructions

**Note:** `@carbon/elements` rolls up a number of Carbon packages that could be
installed independently. As this list of dependencies could change, we leave you
to view `package.json` in ibm-products if you wish to install individual
packages.

## Examples

### Online examples

Examples for each released component, and some that are still not quite ready,
can be found here on

[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/carbon-design-system/ibm-products/tree/main/examples/carbon-for-ibm-products/example-gallery?file=%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FGallery.jsx%3A7%2C26)
[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/carbon-design-system/ibm-products/tree/main/examples/carbon-for-ibm-products/example-gallery?file=src%2Fcomponents%2FGallery.jsx)

### Packages

You can find example projects using the components in the
[examples folder](../../examples/carbon-for-ibm-products).

## Usage

To start using the components

```jsx
import { AboutModal } from '@carbon/ibm-products';

const App = () => {
  return <AboutModal />;
};
```

### Package prefix

The `@carbon/ibm-products` package uses a default prefix of `c4p` for CSS
selectors and some IDs.

#### Changing the prefix

Before any `@carbon/ibm-products` components are loaded in script or styling
ensure you have done the following.

```js
import { pkg } from '@carbon/ibm-products/es/settings';

pkg.prefix = 'tst';
```

When using multiple components from the library:

```css
@use '@carbon/ibm-products/scss' with (
  $pkg-prefix: 'tst'
);
```

When using individual components e.g. AboutModal:

```css
@use '@carbon/ibm-products/scss/config' with (
  $pkg-prefix: 'tst'
);

@use '@carbon/ibm-products/scss/components/AboutModal';
```

See the
[example gallery](https://ibm-products.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/overview-examples--c-4-p-gallery-code-sandbox)
for the most up-to-date prefix examples.

### Enabling Canary components and flagged features

Components that have not yet completed the release review process are considered
to be canary and require the consumer to enable via a feature flag in a
`config.js` file.

For example, create a `config.js` in your `src` directory:

```js
import { pkg } from '@carbon/ibm-products';

// Enable 'canary' (not yet reviewed/released) components
// that we want to make use of
pkg.component.AboutModal = true;
pkg.component.SidePanel = true;

// Live dangerously: enable all components!
pkg.setAllComponents(true);

// Enable a feature flagged examples
pkg.feature.nameOfFeature = true;
pkg.feature['Component.feature'] = true;

// Live dangerously: enable all pre-release features!
pkg.setAllFeatures(true);
```

The default values for component and feature flag settings can be found by
running the following command.

```bash
node node_modules/@carbon/ibm-products/flags.js
```

**Note:** The above settings must happen before a component first renders or a
feature is first used.

**Note: 2** In the case of features implemented via hooks the feature may
function without enabling. In all cases features that disabled by default will
log in the console a warning if enabled via a feature flag or an error if not.

### Building and running locally

To get started, run the following commands and Storybook will be built and then
served on port `3000` on your local machine.

```shell
yarn install
yarn storybook
```

To build all the packages, run the following command.

```shell
yarn build
```

## Browser support

This library supports the latest versions of:

- Apple Safari
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

## 🙌 Contributing

This project is made possible by several community members who have invested
their precious time to give back to the Carbon community. It will continue to be
possible by having those that benefit from the package contribute back to it.

So, do not be shy. We both depend on and appreciate contributors, new and old,
who help us fix bugs, build new features, improve our documentation, etc.
