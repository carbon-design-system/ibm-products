## Overview

[Coachmarks](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/components/onboarding/coachmark/usage)
are just-in-time messages used to draw a user’s attention to a particular spot,
and explain new functionality or concepts they might not otherwise notice or
understand.

**Note:**

- The target prop should always be either a CoachmarkBeacon or a
  CoachmarkButton.
- BEACON_KIND, COACHMARK_OVERLAY_KIND, COACHMARK_ALIGNMENT are enums exported as
  a convenience from Coachmark.

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Note on theming

The Coachmark uses the theme prop (e.g., theme='dark') to set the appropriate
background and font colors for the overlay. Specify a value ('light' or 'dark')
to display properly within your usage.

## Tooltip example usage

<Canvas className="coachmarkExample" withSource="none">
  <div className="CoachmarkBaseExampleUsage">
    <Story of={CoachmarkStories.tooltip} />
  </div>
</Canvas>

```jsx
<Coachmark
  theme={'light'}
  target={<CoachmarkBeacon label="Show information" kind={'tooltip'} />}
>
  <CoachmarkOverlayElements closeButtonLabel="Done">
    <CoachmarkOverlayElement
      title="Hello World"
      description="this is a description test"
    />
  </CoachmarkOverlayElements>
</Coachmark>
```

## Floating example usage

<Canvas className="coachmarkExample" withSource="none">
