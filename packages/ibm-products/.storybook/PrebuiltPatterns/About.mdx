# About

Patterns can be accomplished in multiple ways utilizing a combination of component(s) with additional design considerations.
The prebuilt patterns in this library are based on existing [patterns](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/patterns/overview/patterns/)
documented on the Carbon for IBM Products website, however, they are built like traditional components that can also be imported directly for use.

While these prebuilt patterns are available for use, they only capture a subset of use cases from the broader patterns they represent and may
result in limitations in their component APIs. For a more flexible approach, consider leveraging the equivalent pattern code.

## Current mapping of prebuilt pattern to patterns

| Prebuilt pattern name                | Pattern |
---------------------------------------|----------
| Add and select `MultiAddSelect`      | —
| Add and select `SingleAddSelect`     | —
| `APIKeyModal`                        |
