## Overview

CoachmarkStacked appears fixed at the bottom right corner of the browser window
when the page loads. It starts in a minimized state, to cover as little of the
UI as possible; when shown in tests as expanded by default, users immediately
closed it without reading, to get it out of the way. CoachmarkStacked can
include ghost buttons to trigger another layer to slide up to stack on top of
it, much like the stacked Tearsheet. When dismissed, the stacked layer exits by
sliding back down, revealing the main layer. When the main layer is dismissed,
it slides down off the page. Only one layer can be stacked on the main layer.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:

- [Coachmark](https://carbon-for-ibm-products.netlify.app/?path=/docs/preview-onboarding-coachmark--overview)
- [Button](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button)
- [Link](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-link)
- [Theme](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-theme)
- [Carousel utility](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/packages/utilities/src/carousel/README.md)

```jsx
import { Button, Theme, Link as CarbonLink } from '@carbon/react';
import {
  preview__CoachmarkTagline as CoachmarkTagline,
  preview__Coachmark as Coachmark,
} from '@carbon/ibm-products';
import { InitCarousel, initCarousel } from '@carbon/utilities';
```

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview/)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.
