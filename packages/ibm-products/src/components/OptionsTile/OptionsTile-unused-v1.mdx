## Overview

The options tile is a disclosure widget, grouping a set of related controls or
information while providing a summary of its contents when collapsed. It is used
to avoid overwhelming the user with too many choices and elements when theyâ€™re
likely not interested in all available options, but only a subset.

An options tile can also be paired with a toggle to enable or disable an entire
set of features with ease.
