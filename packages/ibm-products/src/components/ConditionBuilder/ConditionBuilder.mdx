## Overview

The Condition Builder component empowers non-technical users to create
conditional statements with minimal or no coding knowledge. It is available in
two variants: **Non-Hierarchical**: Ideal for simple, linear conditions
presented in a sentence-like format. **Hierarchical**: Designed for more complex
use cases, allowing nested conditions and multiple top-level groups. Users can
build conditions using a list of properties defined in the inputConfig. Each
property supports six built-in input types—option, text, textarea, number, time,
and date—as well as a custom type that allows users to render their own custom
components.

### inputConfig

**Input types** <br/> **option :** Support single select as well as multi
select. Multi-select will be activated for one-of operator or user preferred
multi select custom operator. User can pass the list of options inside config
object (`properties[i].config.options`) or can be dynamically populated using an
asynchronous callback prop `getOptions`.

**text**, **textarea**, **number**, **date**, & **time :** Here the component
uses the corresponding Carbon components and supports standard Carbon props.

The date range picker can be enabled when using the '`between`' operator or user
preferred multiselect custom operator. Eg: you can customize the date format and
locale by setting `properties[i].config.dateFormat` and
`properties[i].config.locale`, respectively.

**custom :** Users can render a custom component by providing a
`properties[i].config.component`, which should be a function that returns JSX.
This function receives `onChange` and `conditionState` as arguments. To update
the condition builder’s state, users must call `onChange('value')` with the new
value.

Additionally, a `valueFormatter` can be specified via
`properties[i].config.valueFormatter` to format how the value is displayed in
the UI.

```
valueFormatter: (value) => {
 // add any customization to the value to be populated
 return value.toLocaleUpperCase();
}

```

### readOnly mode

The condition builder can be rendered in a read-only mode by setting `readOnly`
prop to true. In this mode, you won’t be able to add or edit conditions, but you
can still navigate through them using the keyboard.

### Custom operators

Default operators are built-in for all input types, but users can override them
by passing a list of custom operators via properties[i].config.operators,
including for the custom input type.

Additionally, to enable multiselect or range picker functionality for option and
date input types, users can set `isMultiSelect` to `true`.

```
const customOperators = [
  { label: 'has value', id: 'hasValue' },
  { label: 'has no value', id: 'hasNoValue' },
  { label: 'has values', id: 'hasValues', isMultiSelect: true },
];
```

### Custom statements

Currently, the default statements available are: if all, if any, unless all, and
unless any. But user can pass `statementConfigCustom`, which allows users to
provide their own custom statements, overriding the default ones.

```
const statementConfigCustom = [
  {
    id: 'if',
    connector: 'and',
    label: 'if',
  },
  {
    id: 'exclIf',
    connector: 'or',
    label: 'excl. if',
  },
];
```

### Disable/hide specific property

Each property in the condition builder can be dynamically disabled or hidden
while conditions are being built. For this, the property config supports
getIsDisabled and getIsHidden callbacks. These functions are evaluated during
rendering of each property option in the dropdown, and they receive the current
condition and group state so they can decide whether the property should be
available.

```
properties: [
    {
      id: 'continent',
      label: 'Continent',
      icon: Earth,
      type: 'option',
      description: 'Continent',
      getIsDisabled: ({ conditionState, group }) => {

        return true or false;
      },
       getIsHidden: ({ conditionState, group }) => {

        return true or false;
      },
      config: {
        options: [
          ...
        ],
      },
    },
    ...]
```

### Dynamic options

If the input type is set to option and you want to load options dynamically
during condition building—rather than supplying them directly in the
inputConfig—you can use the getOptions callback prop. This asynchronous function
returns a promise that should be resolved with the options array in the expected
format. It receives two arguments: the root condition state and the current
condition.

```
const getOptions = async (conditionState, condition) => {
  switch (condition.property) {
    case 'continent':
     return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const continents = [
         { label: 'Africa', id: 'Africa' },
          ...
        ];
        resolve(continents);
      });
    default:
      return [];
  }
};
```
