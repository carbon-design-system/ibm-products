## Overview

The options tile is a disclosure widget, grouping a set of related controls or
information while providing a summary of its contents when collapsed. It is used
to avoid overwhelming the user with too many choices and elements when they’re
likely not interested in all available options, but only a subset.

An options tile can also be paired with a toggle to enable or disable an entire
set of features with ease.
