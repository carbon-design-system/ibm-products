## Overview

[CoachmarkStacked](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/components/onboarding/coachmark/usage#stacked)
appears fixed at the bottom right corner of the browser window when the page
loads. It starts in a minimized state, to cover as little of the UI as possible;
when shown in tests as expanded by default, users immediately closed it without
reading, to get it out of the way. CoachmarkStacked can include ghost buttons to
trigger another layer to slide up to stack on top of it, much like the
[stacked Tearsheet](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon/ibm-products/components/tearsheet/usage/#navigation).
When dismissed, the stacked layer exits by sliding back down, revealing the main
layer. When the main layer is dismissed, it slides down off the page. Only one
layer can be stacked on the main layer.

## About Onboarding

[Onboarding](https://pages.github.ibm.com/security/security-design/department/end-to-end-experiences/onboarding/overview)
is a continuous learning methodology and framework that aims to orient, onboard,
explain, educate, and cultivate novice users into high-functioning power users.

## Note on theming

The CoachmarkStacked uses the theme prop (e.g., theme='dark') to set the
appropriate background and font colors for the child Coachmark elements. Specify
a value ('light' or 'dark') to display properly within your usage.
