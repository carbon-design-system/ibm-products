# Delete and remove pattern

“Removing” is an action that moves information from one location to another. Removal can be both destructive and non-destructive. “Deletion” is the most common type of removal and is destructive

Patterns have multiple ways of accomplishing a user need and typically use a combination of components with additional design considerations. The pattern code we share is meant to serve as an example implementation that can be built and extended further.

To build this pattern, we recommend including the following components:
- [cds-modal](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-modal)
- [cds-text-input](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-text-input--overview)
- [cds-toast-notification](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-notifications-toast--overview)
- [cds-button](https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--overview)

## Example

### High impact deletion

A high-impact deletion cannot be reversed. The action would result in a significant loss for a user if done accidentally.

When deleting is high-impact, a confirmation dialog should be presented to the user which displays:

- The name of the resource
- Consequences of the deletion
- This action cannot be undone.
- An editable text field for the name of the resource to be entered

For high-impact scenarios, a user should confirm the action by manually entering the name of the resource. The ‘Delete’ button is enabled when the text entered perfectly matches the resource name.

<Canvas layout="fullscreen" >
  <Story of={deleteStories.highImpactDeletion} />
</Canvas>

### Medium impact deletion or removal

A medium-impact deletion is one that cannot be reversed, but would not be catastrophic if done accidentally. When deleting is medium-impact, a confirmation dialog should be presented to the user which displays:

- The name of the resource
- Consequences of the deletion
- The action cannot be undone.
 
<Canvas layout="fullscreen" >
  <Story of={deleteStories.mediumImpactDeletion} />
</Canvas>

### Low impact deletion

Requiring the user to confirm deletion is generally recommended. However, in low impact situations, or when an ‘undo’ option is available, user confirmation may not be required.

<Canvas layout="fullscreen" >
  <Story of={deleteStories.lowImpactDeletion} />
</Canvas>

### Remove pattern

The medium and low-impact removal patterns are similar to their corresponding deletion patterns, with the only difference being the usage of “remove” or “delete“ in the text.

Use “remove” when the action is reversible or not truly destructive.
